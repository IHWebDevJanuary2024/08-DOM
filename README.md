##  CHALLENGE

- 🙅‍♂️ Don't use html, only JS to create your page
- Create an index.html
- Initialize the code for an empty html ("!+return")
- Create an index.js

- Add the script tag to the html (so they are "linked")
- Check if the script is linked by adding a `console.log` at the beggining of your JS file.
- Create a new h1 element with a text with `document.createElement`
- Insert the h1 element in your document (body) with `appendChild`

- BONUS: Add a `section` with 10 `li` elements inside an `ul` (they can all have the same innerText)
(Sould we use a loop? 🤔)
